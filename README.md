## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-website.git
   cd space-website
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server with Vite, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view your Space Website with live reloading.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, use:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `dist` directory.
